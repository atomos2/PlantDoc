<p style='text-align:justify'> Every year millions of crops are affected by disease which leads to a significant loss in the yield. The traditional method of disease detection involves manual inspection of plants, which is often time consuming. To address this issue, we have developed a deep learning model that can detect plant diseases with high accuracy. This web app is an interface to the model that allows users to upload images of plant leaves and get predictions on whether the plant is healthy or diseased. This will help farmers and gardeners to quickly identify diseased plants and take appropriate action to prevent the spread of disease.</p><p style='text-align:justify'> Model is currently trained with 4 plants and with 23 classes, it is based on EfficientModel which is a pre-trained model and has attained has attained 98 percent accuracy with an average of 96-97 percent F1 score for an unknown test sample.</p>"
